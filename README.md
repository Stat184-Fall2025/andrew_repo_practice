# README

## Overview

This repository is part of a learning project focused on practicing Git and GitHub functions. The primary goal is to demonstrate proficiency with commits, branching, merging, issue tracking, and pull requests using project files from a previous assignment.

The final objective is to insert the required Activity 14 QMD and PDF files into the main branch via issues and pull requests.

All operations were completed using the terminal, rather than GitHub Desktop or web-based uploads. This was not required, only a personal choice. 

## Data Sources

All data files used in this project were stored locally. No external datasets were required.
The only setup needed was ensuring that each QMD/PDF file was committed from the correct local file path.

## Process

To manage and submit the Activity 14 deliverables, the following steps were used:

- Created two separate GitHub issues, one for the .qmd file and one for the .pdf file.

- Added each file to the dev branch.

- Created pull requests from dev to main, with each PR addressing the corresponding issue.

- Merged the pull requests into main following successful review and verification.

This process demonstrates the standard professional workflow for connecting issues, commits, and pull requests.
